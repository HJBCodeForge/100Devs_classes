//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
let movies = ['Deathly Hallows', 'Goblet of fire', 'Half Blood Prince']
//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
let firstMovie = movies[0]
//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
let lengthMovies = movies.length

//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?
let lastElement1 = movies[lengthMovies -1]
let lastElement2 = movies[-1]
